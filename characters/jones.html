<h1>Farmer Jones</h1>

<img src="../images/jones.jpg"/ >
<p class="character_text"> Farmer Jones was a very 
    Lazy farmer who did nothing except...drinking
     and sleeping. One day he forgot to feed the
      animals so he got his butt kicked out of the 
      farm. He came back with a gang but the animals
       were smart and still defeated them </p>
