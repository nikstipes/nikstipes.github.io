<h1>Napoleon</h1>

<p class="character_text"> Napoleon was 
    really greedy and didn't  like to share ever 
    since he scared Snowball he stole the windmill 
    plans saying it was his idea and that Snowball 
    was a traitor. Anyone that broke a rule the dose
     would rip their heads off. Napoleon was becoming 
     more like Farmer Jones and it was not pretty.
